# Winter of Code 2021 Final Contribution Report

## Organisation Name : Moja Global
## Mentored by : Padmaja Bhol, Harsh Bardhan
## Aditi Agarwal

## Overview of Project
Moja Global is a non-profit organisation that brings together a community of experts to develop open-source software (FLINT) that allows users to accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the AFOLU sector.

### Contributions

- As proposed in my project proposal, I was assigned to work on creating a dynamic counter for keeping track of number of contrbutors, stars, views and forks on the organisation's github repository.
- I initially started with getting familiar with the codebase, understanding the project and its components.
- In the first phase I worked on the UI of the counter and got it reviwed by the mentors.
- In the second phase I worked on making the counter dynamic by fetching data from the github API of the moja global organisation.
- Link to my PR:

## Future Scope
I hope my contributions proved benefitial to the Moja Global community and I would definitely like to contribute more towards their projects. I'd also like to sincerely thank my mentors for helping me throughout the program, it would've been impossible without their support.

## Overall Experience
I'd like to thanks DSC NSEC for providing me with this amazing opportunity to participate in WoC. I learned a lot about open source culture, writing project proposals and making meaningful contributions. Participating in WoC has opened up new opportunities for me and prepared me for programs like GSOC. All in all, it was an amazing experience.
