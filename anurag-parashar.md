I am a 2nd Year Student at USICT, New Delhi. I am Pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a Web Developer, Winter of Code 2021 is my first open source program that i have contributed to. 

## Overview of Project
[Tech-N-Science](https://technscience.com/) is a great project, it is aimed to help students who are searching for material related to their subjects at one place. Tech-N-Science aims to provide everything from calculators to MCQ questions under one roof so that the students do not have to waste time in searching and collecting resourses from different Websites. The content is made keeping in mind the level of Competitive exams such as JEE MAINS and JEE ADVANCED. Tech-N-Science is developed using React and it is an awesome project.

### Contributions

- I have made several contributions in the past month in this project. After getting familiar with the codebase, I started to develope calculators for NUCLEAR PHYSICS. I developed **6 Calculators** in Nuclear Physics Section of the project. 
- As only the final answer is not enough, the steps and solution are also important for proper understanding of the solution. For this I developed templates for the solution part of the calculators. Based on the user input the values in the steps also get changed. I developed Solution part for calculators of Nuclear Physics, Gravitation, photonics and electromagnetism sections. In total I have developed solution templates of about **35 Calculators** in the project.
-  This all comprises of my contributions in Phase 1 of winter of code.
-  In phase 2 of Winter of Code I developed calculators of Statistical Mechanics in which I developed **6 Calculators** with their solution Templates.
-  I also fixed Bugs in the thermodynamics calculators.

- **Here are my all PRs during Winter of Code 2021** - 
- [nuclear physics calculators](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/269)
- [Some Changes in nuclear physics calculators](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/271)
- [Added gravitation, nuclear physics, electromagnetism solutions](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/303)
- [Added Photonics Solutions and some changes in Q value calculator.](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/307)
- [Added Calculators in Statistical Mechanics. ](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/314)
- [Fixed Thermodynamics Calculators ](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/316)
 
## Future Scope
This project is like a Gold Mine for all those who are preparing of competetive exams like JEE MAIN, JEE ADVANCES, NEET etc. Student gets all the things which are needed for the complete practice of a topic. It contains theory, Calculators for fast Calculations, Formulas, MCQ etc. As this was my first open source program and I am happy that I got an opportunity to work in such awesome project. I will definitely contribute more to the project so that it can benefit the community.

## Overall Experience
First of all I was scared, as this was the first time that I was seeing such a big codebase for the first time. But I am lucky that I got a mentor like [Amit Kumar Mishra](https://github.com/Amit366), he helped me whenever I got stuck. He helped me to run the codebase on my system, whenever I got stuck or I made a mistake, he guided me through. He even answered my doubts when he was ill. I am inspired by his dedication towards the project. I also learned many new things during WOC like git & github, debugging, Some concepts of React, Communication, etc. I also got to meet a team with great skills and made some good connections. Overall it was one of my best experience in my coding journey that I will never forget. Thank you to my mentor and the whole Winter of Code 2021 Team.
