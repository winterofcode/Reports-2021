I had a very positive experience. I was very fortunate to get a chance to be a student developer at Winter of Code. The mentor was so helpful. Regular meetings were organised and proper tasks were given to the members. WOC gave me a chance to learn. Mentor helped and corrected my mistakes. A great work culture was extablished. I am very thankful to my mentor and whole WOC community to give me this opportunity.
