## Goutham Katipelly
I am Goutham Katipelly, a 4th year Btech( Computer science and Engineering) student from Sreyas institute of Engineering and technology. 

I have been learning web development for the past 1 year. I initially started with frontend and learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript. Having learnt the basic building blocks of the web I decided to learn Reactjs framework. I have read about these project and realized that the required skills for these project perfectly match my skill set.I grabbed this opportunity of applying to WOC 2021 and got selected in the organisation Tech-N-Science.


## Overview of Project
Fun with science is a project which consists of multiple calculators that can solve many physics, chemistry and math problems. It also consists of many questions to practice. The questions are manly focused on the students preparing for JEE and NEET exams. The user can just enter the required values in the calculators provided by the website and the results are provided.

### Contributions

- So for the phase 1, my objective was to build the calculators for atomic physics section.
- I initially started getting familiar with the code base and tried to deeply understand what the project is about and how the functionality was implemented.
- I started with the Einstein's photo electric equation. By implementing it I got a clear idea on how to implement more calculators similar to these.
- Then I proceeded with implementing more calculators in the atomic physics section like radius of the orbit and energy of the electron.I finished these atomic physics section by adding crompton wavelength calculator.
- In the second phase my objective was to implement the calculators in the geometry section.
- I started with the parabola and implemented the parabola calculator, incorporated the main formulas of the parabola. After implementing the parabola calculator I had to change the representation by adding two forms of parabola. The same thing was implemented in ellipse.
- In the similar way I started implementing the calculator for ellipse. I also added a new npm package called Fractional to convert decimals into fractional form.
- Here are the links to my PRs : 
- [Added Einstein photo electric, angular momentum,velocity,radius of electron calculators.](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/275)
- [Added more Calculators](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/304)
- [Added Parabola Calculator and Crompton Wavelength](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/318)
- [Modified Parabola, Added Ellipse](https://github.com/Tech-N-Science/FunwithScience/pull/322)
 
## Future Scope
I hope my contributions to the Fun with science project improved it and opens up new possibilities to make more features and benefit from it. I also believe that some new features will be added like -
- Functionality which allows us to change the units of the values.
- Make it available to wider range of audience by improving the responsiveness of the website.
- Include more practice questions for different exams.

## Overall Experience
Overall WOC has been a great experience for me. It was an entry for me to the open source community and motivated me for further 
contributions. My mentor has been a great help and I could learn a lot from him. I got opportunities to learn more about git, github and open source best practices. I also learnt on how to solve the merge conflicts and address them. Participating in these program helped me build better connections. I also learnt that proper communication is an important soft skill in software engineering.I express my sincere thanks to my mentor [Amit Kumar Mishra](https://github.com/Amit366). He was very supportive and guided me in resolving the conflicts, and helped me solve many issues that occured in the project.
