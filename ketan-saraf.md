# Winter of Code 2021 Final Contribution Report 🙌

## Organisation Name : Gepton 🐦
## Mentored by : Abhibhaw Sir

## 📕 Overview of Project 

[Gepton-Galena](https://github.com/GEPTON-INFOTECH/galena) is an open-source project to build a portfolio website for the organisation Gepton. Gepton is an incubating tech-based startup that is working on empowereing businesses with latest technologies. The puropse of the project was to build a aesthetic static website for the organisation. The website was to be made using fundamental UI/UX principles to decrease bounce rate. The website should also display the past work of the organisation and serve as a medium between the organisation and its clients. 

### 💪 Contributions 

- To start off WOC, my mentor implemented an ideation and bonding weekly meeting schedule. This was done to keep the contributors engaged and to improve the outline of the existing product. I had shown active participation in these meetings.
- In the First Phase , I was given the task of redesigning the existing website to suit and match the organisation's goals and vision.
- To successfully complete this task, I started learning the tool Figma which is used to build website mockups. By learning this tool, I gained more confidence in my front-end designing skills.
- After learning Figma, I started learning about UI/UX design principles which can retain users and also decrease bounce rate. This was a quite a fulfilling task as I got learn about the theory behind each succesful company's web design.
- After learning UI/UX design principles, I started using these skills to revamp the design of Gepton's website.
- I successfully designed the Landing Page, About Page and Project Page. 
- Then to implement my designs, I started learning Gatsby (a React static website generator framework). I am very thankful to my mentor for providing me with the resources to learn this framework. He not only provided me with a free learning resource but also gave me the required guidance to learn it.

## ⚡ Future Scope 

Having an entrepreneurial spirit, I have always wanted to work with startups. Working with Gepton and contributing more to its website would be a great opportunity for me to expand my horizons. Seeing the final launch of the website would be a great experience for me.

## 🔥 Overall Experience 

Winter of Code has provided me with a truly colloborative and growth-oriented environment which promotes learning. My takeaway from this program would be the newly added tools in my arsenal such as Figma and Gatsby, and a greater clarity in using tools like Git and GitHub. But still my greatest takeaway would be the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals who not only supported me but also guided me throughout the period. 

> **Thank you for such a gratifying experience! 😀**
