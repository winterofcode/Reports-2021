# Winter of Code 2021 Final Contribution Report

## Organisation Name : Gepton/Galena
## Mentored by : Satyaprakash Karshama
## Randie Thathsaranie

## Overview of Project
Project Galena is a simple single-page portfolio website which is more suitable for frontend developers.
### Contributions

#### Phase 1 - Setup linting and other necessary repo boiler-plates
- Since this is the first time I am using GatsbyJs, initially I started getting familiar with it. Did some pre-learning before entering the actual project.
- Galena project was in the initial stage so understanding the codebase was not that hard after learning the Gatsby basics.
- I set up the project with JavaScript Standard Style and added a basic Project Structure setup with components.

#### Phase 2 - Implement landing component and product component
- I added React-scroll to the navigation bar to scroll to the components.
- Created the landing component and the product component by using the Figma UI design as a reference.

## Future Scope 
I hope my contribution to the project Galena is beneficial and there are a lot more improvements to be done to make it a complete project. I definitely like to work on this project in the future to contribute to those features as well. 

## Overall Experience
This is my very first experience in open source contribution, it has been a great experience for me. Winter of code gave me the motivation and it is a good kick start to my open-source contribution journey. I learned new technologies and got opportunity to explore new features in git and GitHub which I couldn't experience before. I would like to thank [Abhibhaw Asthana](https://github.com/abhibhaw) for being supportive and friendly throughout WOC.
