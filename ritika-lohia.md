### Contributions

#### In phase 1, my task was to built a form page which collects the data from user manually. 
- I made a figma prototype for the form.
- After learning and became familiar with the react and ant-design. I have built form page. 
- It has inputs and a loading button and after clicking it, notification also pop-up.

#### In phase 2 my task was to store the data in mongodb database.
- After clicking on save button, the whole data is updated in the user's database.
- And display it on dashboard from database.

## Future Scope
I and my team have made overall project user freindly with pleasing user interface. It opens up the possibilities of raising new issue and resolve and for more features also.
The learning and experience will definitely help me in future toparticipate in GSoC and outreachy program.

## Overall Experience
It was a great experience for me. I was a beginner in react, and didn't know about ant-design, data fetching. But during this time period, I have learnt new skills, framework and also dealing with database. Mentors managed the team perfectly, they scheduled the regular meetings, assigned the tasks to all members. They have maintained the profesional work culture. All my co-participants are very good, communicative, down to earth people and WOC gave the chance to learn alot from them. I express my sincere thanks to my mentors and co-members for guiding me and helping me in resolve the conflicts.
