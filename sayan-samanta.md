# Winter of Code 2021 Final Contribution Report

## Tech-N-Science : FunwithScience
## Mentored by : Amit Kumar Mishra

## Overview of Project
FunwithScience is the project to make your life easy by providing some physics, mathematics complex calculators which takes few milliseconds to calculate certain complex values.
Also it provides the questions section to assess your learning. Here the user just needs to enter the values and the project calculates the result using the formula within milliseconds.
This is faster because it needs no server side interaction while calculating and all. It is built using react.js for calculators, pages and php for backend.

### Contributions

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Fixed the responsiveness of calculators</h4>
    (BEFORE) Previously the calculator page was like this:
    <br><br>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67837886/150367660-8742354c-3f98-4304-bbf2-2082dbcb216e.png" />
    <br>
    (AFTER) I have made the page looked like this:
    <br><br>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67837886/150367832-30eb25bb-af03-4936-a297-2bef69517f01.png" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Added image blurred fast load</h4>
    (BEFORE) Previously the image was taking much time to load in login and signup page:

    <br>
    (AFTER) I have optimised the image loading to load blurred version first to give better user experience:

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Implemented the "previous" button with logic and changed the UI in the questions page</h4>
    (BEFORE) The questions pages were not responsive and there are no "previous" button:
    <br><br>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67837886/150642368-82986038-41df-4a0e-a1be-a737682598cb.gif" />
    <br>
    (AFTER) I have implemented the "previous" button along with UI, responsivenss modifications:
    <br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Implemented slide animation on page routing</h4>
    Upgraded the react-router-dom version 5 to version 6 in the project and implemented react-slide-routes in page routing:

  </li>
</ol>

 
## Future Scope
This project is really helpful for everyone who wants to calculate complex calculations and learn formulas with explanation. I am also very much impressed with that motive. I will keep contributing whenever any innovative idea will come to me. It has a very bright future scope.

## Overall Experience
I am contributing to a real world large scale project for the first time through this. So my experience remained really great with the team. My mentor was really helpful throughout the time. This experience helps me to have more motivation towards future open source contribution. Last but not the least to mention that this project helped me to learn a lot while contributing to it, which was my main motive for the participation.
