# Winter of Code 2021 Final Contribution Report

## Organisation Name : Coding Space
## Mentored by : Rishi Purwar
## Shwet Khatri

## Overview of Project
CodingSpace is the platform aimed to provide lots of different real-world UI-based challenges that can help developers to improve their web and mobile development skills.
It provides very interactive challenges to practice and informative solutions to get new ideas about solving those challenges. 
Also provides one of the best resources gathered from research which can be helpful to learn web and mobile development and will be providing roadmaps for them very soon.


### Contributions

- As proposed in my project proposal, I was assigned to add Like and Comment System to solution details page on codingspace platform, 
so developers can like and give constructive feedback to the solutions uploaded by fellow developers on the platform itself.
- This was the [Issue](https://github.com/rishipurwar1/coding-space/issues/69) mentioned on GitRepo.
- I initially started with getting familiar with the codebase, understanding the project and its components.
- In the First phase, I worked on implementing the UI on solution details webpage for comments, subcomments, likes etc. 
- I was given a required figma design and I implemented a separate component for it using code and styles and got it reviewed by the mentor.
- In the Second phase, I added actual functionalities to the UI, so that user can dynamically add comments, can add,update and remove subcomments to any comment as an reply,
can like the comment or subcomment etc. which is also reviewed by the mentor few days before the completion of second phase.

## Future Scope
I would like to solve more issues and contribute more to codingspace. I have some more awesome ideas in mind that will make the platform really useful to users, that I will try to build in future.
The platform will be very very useful to someone who is just starting or beginner in web or app development.

## Overall Experience
It was such an awesome experience contributing during this program. I learnt many new things from codingspace and from its mentor. 
The mentor was always happy to resolve my queries, guide me for better approach. I'd like to thank him and codingspace for providing me such a precious opportunity.
Participating in WoC has opened up new opportunities for me and prepared me for programs like GSOC. All in all, it was an amazing experience.
I'd surely take part in such open source events in future as well.
